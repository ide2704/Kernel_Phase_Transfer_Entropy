# Kernel-based_Phase_Transfer_Entropy

Phython implementation of the Kernel-based phase transfer entropy method proposed in the paper "Kernel-based phase transfer entropy with enhanced feature
relevance analysis for brain computer interfaces". 

The script Main_Phase_kTE_NMM.py reproduces the results shown in Figure 5 (column A, second topmost row, for a coupling strength of 0.5) of the paper for the proposed method. 
The method itself is implemented in the script TransferEntropy.py.
